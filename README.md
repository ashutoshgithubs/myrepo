#Read me please!!
A README file is an essential guide that gives other developers a detailed description of your GitHub project.

1) A good README helps your project to stand out from other projects and should be as good as your project itself.
2) It’s the first thing to notice while encountering your project, so it should be pretty brief but detailed.
3) The quality of a README description differentiates a good project from bad ones.
4) Many times README.md is hosted as a website; make sure your webpage looks as cool as your project!

Contents of Readme File:
